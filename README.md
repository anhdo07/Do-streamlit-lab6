# IMT 561 Streamlit Lab Starter

## Quickstart
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # (Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate)
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Audience
This Streamlit dashboard provides an interactive platform to analyze NYC 311 service request efficiency. By visualizing the response_time_days across various dimensions (borough, complaint type, and channel), the dashboard helps identify service bottlenecks and geographic trends in local responsiveness.

## Target Audience
The stakeholders for this dashboard will be City Administrators, Urban Data Researchers, and even NYC citizens to uncover the trends of 311 service requests response across different metrics and understand how submission channels (App, Phone, Web) impact the speed of city services.

## Tasks
Identify the median and distribution of response times to establish performance baselines.

Compare service efficiency between the five boroughs to identify resource allocation needs.

Identify extreme delays and understand the "long tail" of tickets.

Drill down into specific complaint types or submission channels to see how services are performing in real-time.
